Research project at **Heudiasyc Lab** developing large-scale foundation models for autonomous vehicle perception and decision-making. The models integrate vision, lidar, and linguistic data to enable robust understanding of dynamic environments.

Key contributions include novel attention architectures for multi-modal fusion, zero-shot learning capabilities for new scenarios, and real-time inference optimization for edge deployment in autonomous systems.
