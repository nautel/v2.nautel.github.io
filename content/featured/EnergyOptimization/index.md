Industrial machine learning solution for **VATEC Energy** and **Vietnam Electricity** optimizing power grid operations and reducing energy waste by **25%**. The system processes real-time sensor data from thousands of grid components to predict failures and optimize load distribution.

Implemented advanced forecasting models, anomaly detection pipelines, and automated decision systems that improved grid stability while reducing operational costs by millions of dollars annually.
